Steps to Reset an Unreal Project.

1. "Check-out" or "Reset" to a working commit.
2. Delete the derived folders: .vs, Binaries, Build, Intermediate, Saved folders
    Delete the derived files: .sln, .VC.db
    Leave the Config, Content, and Source folders, and the .uproject file.
3. Reopen Unreal from the launcher or the .uproject file (this recreates generated.h files).
4. Generate your IDE project files: right click on the .uproject file then open the .sln file.
