Steps to Reset an Unreal Project.

1. "Check-out" or "Reset" to a working commit.
2. Delete the derived folders: .vs, Binaries, Build, Intermediate, Saved folders
    Delete the derived files: .sln, .VC.db
    Leave the Config, Content, and Source folders, and the .uproject file.
3. Generate your IDE project files: right click on the .uproject file then open the .sln file.
4. Open Visual Studio and rebuild the project (this gives us a clean build).
5. Reopen Unreal from the launcher or the .uproject file (this recreates generated.h files).
